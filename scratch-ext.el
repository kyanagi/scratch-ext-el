;;; Commentary:
;;
;; scratch-ext.el is extensions for *scratch* buffer.
;;
;; This enables you to dump *scratch* buffer automatically
;; when it is killed or Emacs quits.
;;
;; In addition,
;; * killing *scratch* becomes simply (erase-buffer) it.
;;   So you can easily undo it.
;; * After you save *scratch* to file by hand, new *scratch* buffer is created.
;;

;;; Usage:
;;
;; Add following line to your start up file:
;;
;;     (require 'scratch-ext)
;;
;; Log file goes to ~/.scratch directory by default. You can change this
;; by customizing `scratch-ext-log-directory'.
;;
;; You can bind a key for `scratch-ext-insert-newest-log' and
;; `scratch-ext-restore-last-scratch' if you prefer:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i") 'scratch-ext-insert-newest-log)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'scratch-ext-restore-last-scratch)
;;
